### *Declaring variables*

One of the most powerful features of a programming language is the ability to
define and manipulate variables. A variable is a named location that stores
a value. Values may be numbers, text, images, sounds, and other types of
data. To store a value, you first have to declare a variable.

```java
String message;
```
