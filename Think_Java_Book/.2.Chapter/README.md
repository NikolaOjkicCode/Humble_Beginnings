# Variables and operators

```java

public class VariablesAndOperators{
  public static void main(String[] arg){
    
    String firstName;  
    String lastName;
    
   }
}
```
     This example declares two variables with type String and two with type
     int. When a variable name contains more than one word, like firstName,
     it is conventional to capitalize the  rst letter of each word except the  rst.
     Variable names are case-sensitive, so firstName is not the same as firstname
     or FirstName.
