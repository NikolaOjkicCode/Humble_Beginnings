### *Math methods*

The Java library includes a Math class that provides common mathematical
operations. Math is in the java.lang package, so you don't have to import it.
You can use, or invoke, Math methods like this:

```java
double root = Math.sqrt(17.0);
double angle = 1.5;
double height = Math.sin(angle);
```
